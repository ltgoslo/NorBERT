# NorBERT
This repository contains in-house code used in training NorBERT: a large-scale Transformer-based language model for Norwegian.

For general training, [BERT For TensorFlow from NVIDIA](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/TensorFlow/LanguageModeling/BERT) was used. We made minor changes to their code, to be published later.
